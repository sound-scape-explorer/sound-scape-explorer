# Filing an Issue

We always encourage users to report bugs as soon as they experience them. In
order to keep everything organized here are some questions you should ask
yourself before reporting:

## Common mistakes

- Have you followed everything on the
  [wiki](https://github.com/sound-scape-explorer/sound-scape-explorer/wiki)?
- Is your Python virtual environment active?
- Did you download the latest version of SoundScapeExplorer?
- Have you checked the versions of Python, Node.js and pnpm?

## General issues

- Are you using the latest version of SoundScapeExplorer? Run the [installing
  or updating SoundScapeExplorer
  guide](https://github.com/sound-scape-explorer/sound-scape-explorer/wiki/installing-or-updating-sse),
  then try again.
- Has this issue been reported already? Please check the [list of open
  issues](https://github.com/sound-scape-explorer/sound-scape-explorer/issues).

## Advice

If you're sure you've followed all instructions and haven't made any of the
common mistakes listed above, here are some guidelines for creating an issue:

- Is this an issue with SoundScapeExplorer itself, or an installation error, or
  are you looking for help with your configuration? The SoundScapeExplorer issue
  tracker is for SoundScapeExplorer issues only. Try the [GitHub Discussions
  tab](https://github.com/sound-scape-explorer/sound-scape-explorer/discussions),
  [Discord](https://github.com/sound-scape-explorer/sound-scape-explorer/wiki/discord).
- When you ask a question, make sure it's not [an XY
  problem](http://xyproblem.info/).
- Provide as much information as you possibly can. Copy and paste shell and
  browser console outputs.
- Issues are formatted by
  [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you
  paste code into your issue, it will probably end up appearing quite broken
  because it was interpreted as Markdown. Enclose blocks of code with three
  backticks (\`\`\`) at the start and end to make it a nicely formatted code
  block.

## In your issue, please

- List all operating system names and versions involved in the issue, as well
  as the version of SoundScapeExplorer, your Python version, your Node.js
  version, your pnpm version, and your browser name and version.
- List any other software name/version you think may be related.
- Link to any relevant files (such as `.h5` storage file).
- Include any error messages you see.
- List steps to reproduce.

The more information you have, the better. Post as much as you can related to
the issues to help us resolve it in a timely matter. If you have multiple
issues, please file them as separate issues. This will help us sort them out
efficiently.

Don't ask a question not related to the topic of the current issue, especially
if it's on someone else's issue. This is known as [thread
hijacking](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Thread+Hijacking).
You should create a new issue, or ask on another discussion forum. To contact a
specific developer, find their GitHub profile and look for their email address,
or Twitter, etc.

Thanks!

# Contribution Standards

Don't be afraid to contribute to the development of SoundScapeExplorer! Even if
you don't think you've contributed much, it's still greatly appreciated.

Please make sure you abide by these contribution standards so we can retain a
high quality codebase and make it easy for everyone to understand and
contribute to the code.

- Follow all coding standards set by existing code in the repo. Using your own
  preferences over the established ones for the project just ends up making the
  code messy.
- Use a commit message using [angular
  guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). The
  first line of commit messages should not be longer than 70 characters. Any
  subsequent lines should not be longer than 80 characters.
- An explanation of what the commit's changes do in your commit message is
  extremely useful. It helps people to more quickly understand what your code is
  doing.
- When you submit a pull request, be willing to accept criticism. We don't
  criticise to make you feel bad - we want you to know where you may have made a
  mistake and this helps you grow as a developer.
